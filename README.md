# TinderSwiperBOT
This is a Python script that automates the process of logging in to Tinder using Facebook credentials, granting location and notification permissions, and repeatedly liking profiles for a given number of iterations. It uses the Selenium library to interact with the Tinder website, and specifically targets the relevant HTML elements using their XPATH or CSS_SELECTOR values. The script also handles several exceptions that might arise during the process, such as when certain popups or buttons are not immediately available or when the like button is intercepted by another element. Overall, the project demonstrates how automation can be used to streamline repetitive tasks on web applications like Tinder.
